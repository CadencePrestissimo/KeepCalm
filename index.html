          <h3 class="heading">HOW IT SPREADS</h3>
          <p class="para">COVID-19 spreads mainly by droplets produced as a result of coughing or sneezing of a COVID-19 infected person. This can happen in two ways:
<br></br><b>1. Direct close contact:</b> one can get the infection
by being in close contact with COVID-19
patients (within one Metre of the infected
person), especially if they do not cover their
face when coughing or sneezing.
<br></br><b>2. Indirect contact:</b> the droplets survive on
surfaces and clothes for many days. Therefore,
touching any such infected surface or cloth
and then touching one’s mouth, nose or eyes
can transmit the disease.
<br></br>The incubation period of COVID 19 (time between
getting the infection and showing symptoms) is
1 to 14 days
<br></br>Some people with the infection, but without any
serious symptoms can also spread the disease.
<br></br>So, STAY SAFE , STAY HOME</p>
